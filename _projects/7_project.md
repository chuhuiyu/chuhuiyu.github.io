* Pre-processed 55.6G structural and functional MRI data from 66 undergraduates using MATLAB packages such
as SPM and FreeSurfer.
* Used hypothesis testing (one sample t-test, paired t-test, etc.) to find statistically significant activated cerebral
areas serving as input features of trained binary classifiers (like areas in Dorsolateral Prefrontal Lobe).
* Used machine learning methods (SVM, Bayesian classifier, GBDT, and ResNet) to design models of a binary
classifier, predicting whether a given MRI image is from a person at high risk of schizophrenia
