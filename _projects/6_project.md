* Pre-processed 55.6G structural and functional MRI data from 66 undergraduates using MATLAB packages (SPM and
 FreeSurfer). 
* Used hypothesis testing (one sample t-test, paired t-test, etc.) to find statistically significant activated
 cerebral areas(Dorsolateral Prefrontal Lobe), serving as input features of binary classifiers.
* Used machine learning methods (SVM, Bayesian classifier, GBDT, and ResNet) to design models of a binary classifier, predicting whether a given MRI image is from a person at high risk of schizophrenia.
