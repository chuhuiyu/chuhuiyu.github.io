This is a practicum of my Master study, where our team needs to build our distributed machine learning platform from scratch on the Lrz cloud. Below are our progress:

* Set up (Week 1 - 2)
    * create Virtual Machines
    * set up hadoop environment
    * set up ansible automation tool
    * set up spark environment
    * set up dask environment
* PrimeNumber and WordCount Experiments (Week 3 - 4)
    compare the performance of different algorithms to solve the primenumber and wordcount problems.
    * Hadoop - written in java
    * Hadoop - written in scala
    * PySpark
    * Dask
* K-Medoids and (Bisecting) K-Means (Week 5 - 9)
    compare the performance of different algorithms to solve the protein data clustering problem.
