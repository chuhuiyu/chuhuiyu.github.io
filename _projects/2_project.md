Inhibitory Plasticity Balances Excitation and Inhibition in Sensory Pathways and Memory Networks.

In the project of the course "computational neuroscience", we reproduced Fig.1 of Vogel's article about neuronal plasticity<d-cite key="vogels2011inhibitory"></d-cite> by our hand-written hodgkin-huxley model.

comparison between raw figure and our produced result:

   {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/compneuro/compneuro-2.png" class="img-fluid z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
</div>

The whole process:
